- Building the apartment took about 3-4 hours.\
- Had an issue with the lights after building it. Found the solution but took about 4-5 hours to get this fixed as well. \
\
- I liked the assets that we got given and the amount of examples we got to use as examples to help with developing the final submission\
- One thing that was challenging was the lighting. I ended up with many issues by changing certain features of the lighting at the wrong times.}
